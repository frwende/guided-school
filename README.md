# Guided — AI Tutor That Makes You Think

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Guided banner" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/767ff85f-49c4-4e1e-8b89-e92b6f1e6ef8" />


**Guided** is an AI-powered tutoring app for students aged 6–18 that never gives direct answers. It uses the Socratic method to guide students through problems with questions, staged hints, and a Reveal Ladder — so they build real understanding instead of copying answers.

> *The anti-ChatGPT for education.*

## Why Guided

Most students use AI to skip thinking. Guided flips that: it detects when a student is stuck, asks the right question, and only reveals the answer as a last resort. The result is active learning, not passive consumption.

## Features

### For Students
- **Socratic Engine** — never gives the answer directly; guides through questions
- **Reveal Ladder** — 4-stage hint system: nudge → clue → worked example → answer
- **Homework Paste Detection** — detects copy-pasted homework and responds pedagogically
- **Inline Diagram Generation** — Claude draws SVG diagrams instantly for geometry, timelines, graphs
- **Voice Mode** — speak questions, hear answers read back (ElevenLabs or browser TTS)
- **Bloom's Taxonomy Tracking** — every response is tagged by cognitive level (Remember → Create)
- **Curriculum-Aware** — detects school name and adapts to local curriculum

### For Teachers & Parents
- **Dual Role Login** — separate flows for students and teachers
- **School Dashboard** — view student sessions, Bloom's levels, topics covered
- **Multi-Student Management** — add and switch between students
- **Teaching Style Picker** — Socratic, Friendly, Challenger, or Direct modes
